Open source implementation of sockets interface called EZASOKET

This is an open source implementation of IBM's sockets interface commonly used with COBOL. It is also used in other languages. The goal of this library is to allow code that was originally written on the mainframe that uses the EZASOKET interface to be simply recompiled on Linux, UNIX, and Windows.

This library is intended to be compatible with all COBOL compilers. It is hoped that others will contribute patches such that this library will be suitable for other languages as well.

THE LGPL was chosen so that COBOL compiler developers could include this library as part of their installation package without making their COBOL compiler open source. It is the author's wishes that if that is done that the end user be given instructions on how to install an updated library themselves and that doing so will not change their ability to get support from the COBOL vendor.

This project was initially part of OpenKicks and was separated from OpenKicks at the request of the GnuCOBOL project.

If you need a bug fixed or a new feature implemented create a ticket in github for this project.
